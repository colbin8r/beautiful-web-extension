## Development

The extension is based on (Samuel Sim√µes' Chrome extension boilerplate)[https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate]. See (BOILERPLATE.md)[BOILERPLATE.md] for the documentation that shipped with the boilerplate.

### Committing

The project uses `(commitizen)[http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/]` to keep a standard format for commit messages. You can use `npm run commit` to easily adhere to the format.
